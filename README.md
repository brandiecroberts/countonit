# React + Rails No-Fluff Boilerplate

A [boilerplate project](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/react-rails-boilerplate) for anyone interested in making a project that uses React and Rails.

Note! This boilerplate has _no fluff_! That means that there's nothing set up for you to do authentication stuff, there's no Redux stuff, and there's no React Router stuff.

The main important bit is that the React project has `proxy` set to `localhost:3001` in the `package.json` file. Take a look!
